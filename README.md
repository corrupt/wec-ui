# WEC UI

wec-ui is a simple user interface for instrumenting [Website Evidence Collector](https://github.com/EU-EDPS/website-evidence-collector) with a very specific workflow.
* Create a browser profile with certain settings for a given website applied (like tracking banners configured, cookies set, etc..) by starting a browser and giving the user the possibility to interact with the site.
* Starting WEC with the newly created browser profile
